# mods-web-legacy (legacy.frankkmods.com)

As my modding website is being re-written entirely from scratch, this repo is here to preserve some tools that previously existed on it. You can view it online at [legacy.frankkmods.com](https://legacy.frankkmods.com).

It is built with Vue.js, Bootstrap, and Sass. It is served from the `gh-pages` branch of this repository.
